How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	Writing code that can be reused in different modules can make it easily maintainable and adaptive. Also keeping a good documentation on the code that is written
	can help others understand the code.
	
What were the advantages of working in this way? 
		Working in this manner allows for less code to be wasted and for code to be more compact. 
		
How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
	This code can be implemented in future projects using a mongo db and can be expanded to accomedate different actions to be completed withen the database.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
	As a computer scientist, I work by first understanding the requirements and breaking them down into their bare bones. Then I begin solving each step of the problem and look
	for solutions for each step of the problem. 
	
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
	I'm not fimiliar with python, so I had to learn it and adapt to new ideas. I also had to troubleshoot differently due to the way that the database and mongo worked together. 
	
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
	Breaking down the database and its requirements is a must do. I will be using this methodology to better accomedate the requests. 
	
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
	Computer scientist fix problems, make problems and make problems again. This is an ongoing process in computer science that is caused from the ever changing technology.
	
How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
	As previously stated, I would break down the problem into smalled steps to better understand the task and requirements.
